# Trevarn Brand Identity System

*Consolidated from brand exploration — January 2026*
*Decisions required*

---

## 1. Name & Origin

### The Name: Trevarn

- **Cornish origin** — rooted in the Cornish language of Cornwall, England
- **"Tre"** = homestead, settlement, place (one of the most common Cornish prefixes)
- **"varn"** — likely derived from Cornish "barn" (hill/top) or "gwern" (alder grove), giving a meaning along the lines of **"homestead on the hill"** or **"place of the alders"**
- The name evokes: rootedness, place, natural landscape, heritage, Cornwall
- Domain: **trevarn.com**

### Why Trevarn Works

- Distinctive and memorable — not a generic tech/startup name
- Sounds established and real — like a place that already exists
- Short, clean, easy to spell and pronounce
- Cornish "Tre-" names carry cultural weight (Trevose, Trevalgan, Trevaunance)
- Works across digital and physical touchpoints
- No obvious negative associations in any major language

> **DECISION:** Name is confirmed as **Trevarn**. No further naming decisions needed.

## 2. Brand Positioning

### Core Concept

Trevarn is positioned as a brand that is **rooted in place and heritage but modern in execution** — authentic rather than corporate, premium but not exclusive.

### Brand Values (from exploration)

| Value | Expression |
|-------|-----------|
| **Authenticity** | Real, honest, substance over flash |
| **Heritage** | Rooted in place, respecting tradition |
| **Quality** | Crafted with care, built to last |
| **Connection** | To place, to people, to landscape |
| **Simplicity** | Clean, uncluttered, purposeful |

### Brand Personality

- Confident but not arrogant
- Grounded and steady
- Warm but not overly familiar
- Heritage-aware but forward-looking
- Premium without pretension

> **DECISION NEEDED:** What is Trevarn's business/service? The exploration developed the identity but the underlying product/service needs to be defined to refine positioning further.

## 3. Visual Identity System

### Color Palette

The exploration developed a natural, Cornwall-inspired palette:

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | Cornish Slate |  | Headlines, primary text, logo |
| **Secondary** | Harbour Stone |  | Accents, secondary elements |
| **Accent** | Coastal Teal |  | CTAs, links, highlights |
| **Warm** | Heather |  | Warm accent, illustrations |
| **Background** | Porthminster Sand |  | Page backgrounds, cards |
| **White** | Sail White |  | Clean space, contrast |

> **DECISION NEEDED:** Confirm color palette direction. Options:
> 1. **Earth & Coast** (above) — warm, natural, grounded
> 2. **Darker/Moodier** — deeper slate/charcoal primary, more dramatic contrast
> 3. **Lighter/Cleaner** — more white space, lighter tones, minimal color

### Typography

The exploration recommended a serif + sans-serif pairing:

| Role | Font | Style | Usage |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| **Display/Headings** | Cormorant Garamond | Serif, elegant | H1-H3, logo wordmark, hero text |
| **Body** | Inter | Sans-serif, clean | Body copy, UI, navigation |
| **Accent/Mono** | JetBrains Mono | Monospace | Code, technical, data |

- **Cormorant Garamond** — elegant serif with heritage feel, works well at large sizes, free (Google Fonts)
- **Inter** — highly legible sans-serif, modern, excellent for screens, free

> **DECISION NEEDED:** Confirm typography pairing. Alternatives explored:
> 1. **Cormorant + Inter** (above) — heritage meets modern
> 2. **Playfair Display + DM Sans** — bolder contrast, more editorial
> 3. **Libre Baskerville + Work Sans** — classic, professional
> 4. **Custom/other** — commission or source a different pairing

### Logo Direction

Concepts explored in the conversation:

1. **Clean Wordmark** — "TREVARN" in the display serif, letterspaced, standalone. Minimal and confident.
2. **Wordmark + Monogram** — Full wordmark for primary use, "T" monogram for favicons, app icons, small spaces.
3. **Wordmark + Symbol** — A subtle mark (landscape line, geological form, alder leaf) paired with the wordmark.

> **DECISION NEEDED:** Which logo direction?
> - **Option A:** Pure wordmark (simplest, most versatile)
> - **Option B:** Wordmark + T monogram (practical for digital)
> - **Option C:** Wordmark + symbol (more distinctive, but more complex)

## 4. Verbal Identity

### Tagline Options

From the exploration, several directions were developed:

| # | Tagline | Direction |
|---|---------|-----------|
| 1 | **Built on solid ground** | Heritage, reliability, foundation |
| 2 | **Where you begin** | Origin, starting point, home |
| 3 | **Rooted in place** | Connection, authenticity, landscape |
| 4 | **From here, forward** | Heritage as launchpad, progress |
| 5 | **Made to last** | Quality, craftsmanship, longevity |

> **DECISION NEEDED:** Select a tagline (or refine one of the above). Consider:
> - Which aligns best with the business/service?
> - Which works across all touchpoints (web, print, social)?
> - Which is most distinctive?

### Brand Voice Guidelines

| Attribute | Do | Don't |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| **Tone** | Calm, assured, warm | Loud, pushy, corporate-speak |
| **Language** | Plain, clear, purposeful | Jargon, buzzwords, filler |
| **Perspective** | Grounded, considered | Hyperbolic, trend-chasing |
| **Personality** | Like a trusted local guide | Like a billboard or algorithm |

Example voice:
> *"Trevarn is built on the idea that the best things are rooted in real places, made by real people, and designed to stand the test of time."*
